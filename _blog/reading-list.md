## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Feature Factory - No clear Product Goals
A dark pattern I often encounter is the "Feature Factory". Without clear incentives the Producr Owner is just a master of lists where features are guessed while _something_ gets shipped to the users. High recommended read especially in larger organisations:

## üë£ How to grow - with a more traditional mindset
_(German)_ This book provides hard questions and tasks on how to reduce the role of the founder. While the approach itself is more _classic_ than most startups would prefer, I found it really helpful for my self-reflection on how to run and take care of a business for the long-term.
