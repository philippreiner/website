While you can learn about my work on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippreiner/) here are some conversation starters.

## Working Life
- **Startups and Entrepreneurship** I believe that innovation and therefore progress is a result of taking the risk to build something from the ground up.
- **Agile and Collaboration** Leading people to build something complex and huge in small iterations by using agile methods such as Scrum.
- **Future Business Models** The world is changing and so are companies. How businesses work and make money fascinate me - from a local restaurant to global supply chains
- **Teaching other** I'm doing lectures at my local university (DHBW Heidenheim) about Stratic Supply Chain Management and Web Programming.

## On the Weekends
- **Photography** I enjoy taking picture with my Fuji cameras - mostly portrait in a calm way so that I can get to know other persons well. Editing like a professional included.
- **Gaming** Back when graphic card prices were more down to earth, I enjoyed building my gaming rig and playing mostly creative and building-based games.
- **Organising Events** I've organised a 5000 people graduation festival back in school and still like to look behind the scenes at large festival and events. I was also involved in the [Open Beatz Festival](https://www.openbeatz.de) with 15.000 visitors.

##  Interests
- **Electric Cars** While electric cars do not full solve climate and personal transportation issues, driving my Tesla Model 3 is a joy and I truly believe in an electric future for personal cars.
- **Architecture** As a kid, I always wanted to become an architect. Today I read about and enjoy modern architecture and how we use space. I also enjoy The Sims 4
- **Flying and Spacecrafts** Complexe machinery fascinates me. Flying realistic Airbus aircrafts in a Flight sim and understanding how we travel into space fills 
- **Self-Improvement** Setting personal goals, keep my body in shape and thinking how I can improve myself and support others is a live-long task of mine.

Beside I can enjoy a good show on Netflix, go to the cinema or just drink a beer out in the sun with friends. Want to join? Drop me a message.
