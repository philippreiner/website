Imaging what could be possble excites me. \n\nStrategically-minded and technically skilled, I drive growth and innovation while collaborating with technical and non-technical individuals. Patience is not my greatest strength but together we can turn ideas into action. \n\nToday I\u2019m a manager at Accenture. Before that, I supported teams at PlanB, building B2B software. I also co-founded an IIoT startup, where I gained valuable experience in leadership, sales, and product development as our team grew to 15 people. \n\nBeyond work, I capture moments with my camera, like to drive electric cars, hike, and read about entrepreneurship and science-fiction.",
