I enjoy taking photographs- mostly of people, moments and the local landscape. I walk around with a camera, bring one to a friends party or try to document interessting people that I know.

Pictures are rarely shared in public.

### Current Setup

Mostly I'm shooting with Fuji cameras but I was using Sony and Canon before. Camera tech is important but I really prefer cameras that I just like to take out to shoot.

My current cameras include:
- Fujifilm XT-5
- Fujifilm XE-4
- Fujifilm X100V
- Fujifilm X100S
- Fujifilm GFX50R

Lenses include:
- XF16
- XF18
- XF33 
- XF56
- XF18-55
- XF70-300
- GF35-70
- GF45
- EF40 (Adapted)
