## üßë‚Äçüíª Computer
I prefer working with Apple products but still use Windows daily as my gaming computer.

- M1 MacBook Pro 16" for private coding and image editing
- M1 MacBook Pro 14" from work
- Custom Build Gaming Computer
- Huawai MateView 28" Monitor
- Logitech Mouse, Keyboard and Webcam
- Adjustable desk and ergponomic chair

## üëÄ Software & Apps
For some reason I'm always testing the latest new software from some startup. Still, something I can absolutely recommend

- Things 3 for ToDos
- Notion for Notekeeping
- Teams for everything communication
- Adobe Lightroom for editing pictures
- Github for software development

## üì∑ Photograhpy
I enjoy taking photograhps mostly with Fuji cameras but I often sell and buy different gear. Right now I own

- Fuji XT-5 and XE-4 with a XF16, XF18, XF33, XF56, XF70-300 and XF18-55 lenses
- Fuji GFX50R with a GF45, GF35-70 and an adapted Canon 40mm
- Fuji X100V and X100S as the cameras that I would never sell

Before that I owned every XT camera from Fuji with most XF lens on the market. I sold my GFX gear due to size reasons. A few years back I shot Sony and Canon.

## üì± Daily Life

Beside I can recommend from daily usage
- My Tesla Model 3 Long Range 
- Using an iPhone
- The Philips Hue eco-system
