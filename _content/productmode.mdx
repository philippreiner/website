How can non-tech companies (e.g. traditional manufacturers) build great digital products on the first try? I'm exploring this question at the moment in order to help Developers build the software their Product Owner really want.

Why? Most "digital product" approaches are driven by tech-first companies (e.g. Google, Facebook, Tesla). This works well - but most companies that have never built their own software are doing it now. And they struggle alot.

My solution is tailored software tools based on proven tech-methods. This will help companies build better software faster - hopefully on the first try. 

## For Product Owners
In addition I'm documenting my experiences for other to learn from.
