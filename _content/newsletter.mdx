Iâ€™m writing a newsletter for my friends about latest technology, consulting and recommendations from the web.

The newsletter contains links mixed with short insights. I aim to cover a broad range and explain stuff in a plausible manner. There won't be more than 1-2 emails per month.

This is for my friends and former colleagues and totally free. So join today, this would really make me happy.
