Hi, I’m Philipp and I work at the intersection of technology and business. I will think ahead, anticipate trends, and break-down complex challenges. Imagining what could be possible excites me. 

Strategically-minded and technically skilled, I drive growth and innovation while collaborating with technical and non-technical individuals. Patience is not my greatest strength but together we can turn ideas into action. 

Today I’m a manager at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/). Before that, I supported teams at [PlanB](https://www.planb.net), building B2B software. I also co-founded an [IIoT startup](https://www.conclurer.com), where I gained valuable experience in leadership, sales, and product development as our team grew to 15 people.

Beyond work, I capture moments with my [camera](/stuff), like to drive electric cars, hike, and read about entrepreneurship and science-fiction.
