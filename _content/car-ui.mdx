Software inside the car is getting more important and user-facing. From driver-assistance to modern infotainment systems software. What started with Teslas 17" screen as the center of the interior became an industry-wide trend. Large touch-Screens, fancy icons and different approaches for the same main tasks: navigation, playing music and showing climate controls.

## My personal Learnings

- Touchscreens are here to stay. They might not be the best alternative to physcal buttons but try to search a song in spotify with a mechanical keyboard. Voice assistants can help
- All UIs still look cluttered and do not follow design-trends we know e.g. from mobile apps ("Clean"). China and california look like 2023 without too much digital chrome.
- Focus is still on gasoline cars from a long gone era. Climate controls, RPM counter, "blutooth status" are in stark contrast to showing the destination weather forecast (Apple) or just embedding Spotify directly (Tesla, BMW, ...)
- Too many actions, buttons and icons. This would be hard to learn and use even if every of Volkswagen 32 icons would be a physical button. 
- Tesla leads the game with many updates and refreshes across the recent years - and it's not concept art. You can install Steam Games now and customize the UI in every aspect.
- You can see many "stores" and upselling options in the screens.
- Basic UI mistakes can be spotted e.g. in BMWs cut-off Spotify playlists or with Audis too small home tiles.

## Background

During the CES2023 I've started to collect screenshots from car software. I decided to put this into a single graphic. I would recommend a more detailed research for you but take this as a starter.
