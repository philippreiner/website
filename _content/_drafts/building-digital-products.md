When building new and mostly innovative software, two scenarios are likely possible:
- **The competition is well established and feature rich** with a large userbase and working sales processes. They have many features and verticals combined with nearly unlimited ressources. Only the reaction time is slow. Examples: SAP or Microsoft.
- **A previous product is still running well** and built by your current organisation. Features are refined for over a decade. Change might be required - e.g. by a shift from desktop to mobile - but is hard to justify due to current revenue streams and the high effort to rebuild the product.

Startups are often faced with Scenario 1 while a product owner knows the challenge of establishing something new in the current organisation. It's related to the "Innovators Dilema" and even more complicated when your main source of revenue is/was not software.

Still we see the rise of new and better software all the time. 

## Agile Software Products

The best software is developed in cycles (releases) where featurs are added, removed and improved over time. 


## What can be improved

- **Establish a Northstar Metric** to keep the focus towards the most user value.
- **Adapt to new mental models of working** in order to solve problems user didn't have before better that the competition. Google Docs started with realtime-collaboration in the browser and later added all the details.
- **Keep the Context of the JTBD in mind** context means for example that people now work remotely or on mobile devices. Instagram beat
- **Focus on what the current solution can't solve** Outlook with many emails was a mess and emails got missed. Slack fixed this with channels together with realtime co
- **be lean and agile. release early** stuff
- **Agile first** stuff
- **Integration** wenn es beiden mehr nutzt. vorsicht vor falscher integration. beispiel: teams.

## Building Better Software
How to beat established software with less ressources and features - and why most Product Owners need to level up.

software lives in cycles

gets replaced by better ones

might age. how to stay competetive?

as always: agile


## examples
* slack vs. outlook
* sketch vs. photoshop
* figma vs. sketch
* pitch vs. powerpoint
* ...

## How?
good product managmement and compromises.
northstar

## New Mental models
super good features for new mental models
(e.g. collaboration instead)

## Agile and on
Iterate and improve
grow into existing featues
